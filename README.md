# About the Game

## Overview

For my final project for Harvard CS50x, I decided to create a side scroller video game called “King of the Jungle,”
which is coded in Lua. Once the program is run, the game opens up to a title screen; then pressing enter starts the game.
In this game, your avatar is a gorilla wearing a crown. You have to jump over blocks, avoid enemies, and collect bananas on
your journey through the jungle. If you get pushed past the end of the screen on the left, you lose. If this happens, a game-over message
appears with the accompanying sound, and the game closes. I hand drew the background, avatar, title screen, and all parts of the game along
with animating them. The blocks and bananas are on separate spawn timers with varying rarity. A banana counter shows your score in the top
right corner. The game comes complete with sound effects and music.

## Possible improvements

Like any application there are still things that could be improved for example:
- Add more frames to the animations to create a smoother flow
- Create more varying block shapes and sizes
- Create extra skins that a player can buy with bananas
